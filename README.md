# VRCarnival

For a final group project we created a carnival VR game in Unity. Given this was all our first time we worked with Unity it 
is pretty basic, but we were able to create boardwalk games where a player could pop balloons with a dart and knock over milk
bottles with a ball.

The was an amazing learning experience. It was also fun to model things in Blender. I was able to make a realistic (by my standards-haha)
boardwalk, darts, golf club, and carnival booth.
